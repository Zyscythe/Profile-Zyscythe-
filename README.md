## Inspirations

*   [Punishing Gray Raven]: [We call it the Golden Age, the pinnacle of human civilization. We master quantum computing and cold fusion, climbing the noble ladder of progress, we reach for the stars themselves.]
*   [adalah Ryukishi07]: [About him, his masterpieces made me know what the true meaning of being human is.]

## Dream Projects

I aspire to be a story designer for RPGs or adventure games. I want to create stories about friendship, sacrifice, and self-discovery. My dream role is to focus on worldbuilding and character design.
